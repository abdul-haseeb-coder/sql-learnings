List of 50 real-world SQL tasks to perform in a database application:

### Data Manipulation
1. **Insert New Records**: Add new user or product data to relevant tables.
2. **Update Existing Records**: Modify user details such as email or address.
3. **Delete Records**: Remove outdated or incorrect data entries.
4. **Bulk Insert**: Insert a large dataset in one query.
5. **Batch Update**: Apply updates to a batch of rows based on a condition.
6. **Merge Records**: Combine two data sources into one table, updating existing and inserting new data.
7. **Upsert (Insert or Update)**: Add new data if it doesnâ€™t exist, or update if it does.

### Data Retrieval
8. **Basic SELECT Queries**: Retrieve customer order details.
9. **JOIN Queries**: Combine data from `orders` and `customers` tables.
10. **Aggregate Functions**: Calculate total sales revenue or average purchase price.
11. **GROUP BY**: Group orders by product category and calculate total sales per category.
12. **HAVING Clause**: Filter groups with total sales above a certain amount.
13. **Subqueries**: Retrieve the most recent order for each customer.
14. **Window Functions**: Rank products based on sales.
15. **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)**: Create temporary result sets for complex queries.
16. **Self-Joins**: Compare records in a table to find duplicate entries.
17. **Recursive CTEs**: Handle hierarchical data such as organizational charts.

### Data Analysis
18. **Pivot Table Queries**: Create a pivot table to analyze sales per region.
19. **Trend Analysis**: Retrieve data to show monthly growth in customer sign-ups.
20. **Date Functions**: Extract year or month from a date for reports.
21. **Advanced Aggregations**: Use `COUNT`, `SUM`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and `AVG` in complex queries.
22. **CASE Statements**: Add conditional logic to queries.
23. **Percentile Calculations**: Use `PERCENTILE_CONT` to find specific data percentiles.

### Data Integrity and Validation
24. **Foreign Key Constraints**: Ensure referential integrity between `orders` and `customers`.
25. **Check Constraints**: Validate that data values meet specific conditions (e.g., age > 18).
26. **Unique Constraints**: Ensure no duplicate email addresses in a `users` table.
27. **NULL Handling**: Manage queries with `NULL` values effectively.
28. **Data Consistency Checks**: Write queries to find inconsistencies, such as missing data in related tables.

### Performance Tuning
29. **Index Creation**: Optimize query performance by creating indexes.
30. **Query Optimization**: Analyze and rewrite inefficient queries using `EXPLAIN`.
31. **Partition Tables**: Split a large table into smaller, more manageable pieces.
32. **Analyze Query Execution Plans**: Understand query costs and improve performance.
33. **Use of Temporary Tables**: Speed up complex operations by storing intermediate results.

### Security and Access Control
34. **Grant and Revoke Permissions**: Control user access to tables and views.
35. **Create Views**: Provide restricted data access through views.
36. **Use Role-Based Access Control**: Implement roles and grant permissions at the role level.
37. **Audit Trail**: Track changes with a `trigger` that logs operations in an audit table.

### Stored Procedures and Functions
38. **Create Stored Procedures**: Automate complex tasks with parameterized procedures.
39. **Create User-Defined Functions (UDFs)**: Simplify complex calculations within queries.
40. **Trigger Creation**: Automatically perform actions like updating a `log` table when a record changes.

### Advanced Features
41. **Full-Text Search**: Implement searching within text columns for large data sets.
42. **JSON Parsing**: Extract and manipulate JSON data stored in columns.
43. **XML Parsing**: Work with XML data within SQL queries.
44. **Dynamic SQL**: Create and execute SQL dynamically for flexible querying.

### Data Backup and Recovery
45. **Backup Databases**: Create full and incremental backups for data safety.
46. **Restore Databases**: Practice restoring from backups to ensure disaster recovery procedures.

### Data Migration and Transformation
47. **ETL Operations**: Extract, transform, and load data from external sources.
48. **Data Import/Export**: Move data in and out using tools or `BULK INSERT`.
49. **Data Cleaning**: Identify and correct errors or inconsistencies in datasets.

### Monitoring and Maintenance
50. **Database Health Check**: Monitor table sizes, index usage, and query performance metrics.

These tasks cover a broad range of operations you'll encounter in real-world SQL database management and application development.
